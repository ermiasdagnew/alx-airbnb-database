# SQL JOIN Queries

This project demonstrates SQL JOIN operations using MySQL.

## 1. INNER JOIN
Retrieves all bookings and the users who made them.

## 2. LEFT JOIN
Retrieves all properties and their reviews, including properties without reviews.

## 3. FULL OUTER JOIN
Retrieves all users and all bookings, even if they don’t match.
MySQL does not support FULL OUTER JOIN directly — a UNION of LEFT and RIGHT joins is used instead.
